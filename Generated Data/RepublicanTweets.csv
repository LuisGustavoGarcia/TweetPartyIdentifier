"Chiefs of most major police departments have condemned Floyd‚Äôs killing, &amp; many officers are marching in solidarity with peaceful protesters.
 
Chiefs know their personnel and that‚Äôs why we need to give them the authority to fire bad officers &amp; keep them off the force permanently."
"Defunding the police is not the answer.
 
Instead, let‚Äôs tie the almost $2B in federal grants received by state &amp; local law enforcement to following best policing practices.
 
That means more training, compliance with federal civil-rights laws and community policing."

Democrats repeatedly blocked it all. Let's hope they let us make law soon."
"Another Democrat demand that‚Äôs blocked bipartisan aid: The fixation on a massive slush fund for state &amp; city govt's, unlinked from COVID need.

This huge good news is a testament to the ingenuity of the American private sector and the historic groundwork laid by Congress and the Trump Administration. https://t.co/TtcD2TpmJC"
"Here‚Äôs how this must work in our great country: Every legal vote should be counted. Any illegally-submitted ballots must not. All sides must get to observe the process. And the courts are here to apply the laws &amp; resolve disputes.

That's how Americans' votes decide the result."

Tune in now: I‚Äôm joining @ShannonBream on @FoxNews to discuss the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.
"The Senate just confirmed Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States.

One of the most impressive nominees for public office in a generation will serve for life on our highest court. https://t.co/qkJ0FPbTv1"
"The Senate just voted to advance one of the most qualified nominees in generations. Judge Barrett‚Äôs intellectual brilliance, integrity, and commitment to impartiality are above reproach.
 
Tomorrow, we will vote to confirm the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court."
"More coronavirus resources are on the way to Kentucky. With the help of @HHSGov &amp; @usedgov, Kentucky students &amp; teachers will receive more than two million masks.
 
One of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves &amp; others is to wear a mask. https://t.co/1AtyoYmush"
"Democrats cannot use ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù as a synonym for ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt get our way.‚Äù

Democrats keep demanding the President repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. But they're flunking that test badly with Judge Barrett's nomination. https://t.co/Lvf0DtlA6Y"
"For the third time this year, the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts have guided an historic step forward in the Middle East. Yesterday‚Äôs announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Sudan is good news for peace-loving people everywhere."
"With no good arguments to stop Judge Barrett, Democrats have resorted to blatant falsehoods. Inventing fake Lincoln quotes. Lying about this moving faster than many past confirmations.

Facts, not falsehoods, are going to carry the day in the Senate. https://t.co/pxAeYmkfn6"
Tune in now: I‚Äôm joining @DanaPerino on @FoxNews to discuss Judge Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court and Democrats‚Äô continued blockade of COVID-19 relief for struggling Americans.
"This morning, the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Senate floor. Their unanimous recommendation was that she be confirmed. 

This nomination will receive an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor in the next several days."
Our Constitution forbids disqualifying people from public service due to their religious beliefs. The far left has either forgotten this or just doesn‚Äôt care. It only underscores why we need well-informed jurists like Judge Barrett to protect our Constitution &amp; Americans‚Äô rights. https://t.co/9iCPWs3V7P
"Senate Democrats just used the filibuster ‚Äî which they say they dislike ‚Äî to kill another coronavirus relief package.
 
Unemployment benefits. PPP. Testing. Vaccines. School funding. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
 
Every Democrat just voted to block it all."
"NOW: The Senate is voting on another rescue package for American families.

Testing. Treatments. Vaccines. Unemployment aid. Another PPP. Historic money for schools. Find common ground &amp; get help out the door.

We'll see if Democrats use the filibuster to kill the bill."
"Democrats have said we shouldn‚Äôt pass any more relief at all unless Speaker Pelosi gets her whole far-left wish list, including all kinds of non-COVID-related demands. 

Working families in Kentucky and around the country deserve better than this obstruction."
"The Paycheck Protection Program has made a critical difference for millions of working families. Today, I‚Äôm having the Senate vote on a new second round for the hardest-hit small businesses.
 
Democrats say they support the PPP. Let‚Äôs see how they vote."
"Democrats have delayed aid for months over non-COVID-related liberal demands. Last night, Leader Schumer even tried to adjourn the Senate for three weeks. Americans need help; Democrats just want to go home.
 
We are voting on more aid this week."
"Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs all-or-nothing act has kept Americans waiting for months. We badly need Congress to agree where we can, get money out the door now, and keep arguing over the Speaker‚Äôs non-COVID-related wish list later.

We'll vote on hundreds of billions in more aid this week."
"Last week, Judge Barrett proved she has the deep legal expertise, judicial temperament, and intellectual horsepower that Americans deserve to have on the Supreme Court. The Senate will turn to her nomination as soon as it comes out of committee later this week."
I just announced the Senate will vote next week on hundreds of billions more dollars for relief programs that Democrats do not even oppose. Working families have already waited too long for Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs Marie Antoinette act to stop. Let's make law. https://t.co/iR7OYKuCKw
"Judge Barrett exhibited every bit of the intellectual brilliance, legal expertise, and open-minded judicial temperament that we need on the Supreme Court. I will proudly vote to confirm her. The Senate will take up her nomination as soon as it comes out of Committee. https://t.co/KkOGo0JVKL"
It is bizarre to watch Vice President Biden and Democrats refuse to give a straight answer on their own party‚Äôs threats to pack the Supreme Court. But it is even more absurd for them to try to redefine ‚Äúcourt-packing‚Äù to mean any judicial confirmation that disappoints Democrats. https://t.co/RpZbaXNO2m
"We don‚Äôt agree with Speaker Pelosi that ‚Äúnothing‚Äù is better than ‚Äúsomething‚Äù for workers.

Senators will vote on more relief next week, including more PPP money to stop layoffs. We‚Äôll be able to pass it before we turn to Judge Barrett's nomination unless Democrats block it again. https://t.co/paJFhx5HcI"
Judge Barrett is just as brilliant and impressive as advertised. She is clearly qualified. She‚Äôs committed to fairness and impartiality. And she clearly understands the job of a judge under the Constitution is to apply the law and not impose personal policy views.
"The far left has been threatening our basic institutions of government since long before this Supreme Court vacancy. When today‚Äôs Democrats lose one election or one vote on the Senate floor, they start threatening to tear up the rulebook. https://t.co/CT3rnShGZD"
Judge Barrett is a stellar nominee. I think the president picked the single best person he could have picked anywhere in the country. This is a woman of extraordinary achievement. https://t.co/E1pyp1PPHU
"ICYMI: I joined @marthamaccallum to discuss the Senate‚Äôs months of success with hybrid hearings, Judge Barrett‚Äôs outstanding qualifications, and Democrats‚Äô refusal to get serious on COVID-19 relief talks. https://t.co/QrBro8587T"
"The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett‚Äôs faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers. https://t.co/Qg5mFQzWFO"
President Trump made an outstanding choice in Judge Amy Coney Barrett. She is one of the finest legal minds of her generation. She‚Äôs won national admiration for her example of strong female leadership. She‚Äôs exactly the kind of person Americans deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/eYEle2s1nw
"Judge Barrett‚Äôs hearings will begin one week from today. Chairman Graham has all the tools to conduct a hybrid hearing, just like the 150 others the Senate has held this year.
¬†
We will not stop working for the American people because Democrats are afraid they may lose a vote."
"Democrats say they‚Äôll try everything to stall Judge Barrett. The latest excuse: Hybrid hearings with some virtual participation are suddenly bad.¬†

The Senate has held 150 of these hybrid hearings since May. Democrats have taken advantage of the tools. They‚Äôve praised the format."
"Just had another great call with @POTUS. He sounds well and says he‚Äôs feeling good. We talked about the people‚Äôs business ‚Äî fighting the pandemic, confirming Judge Barrett, and strengthening the economy for American families. Let‚Äôs keep our President &amp; First Lady in our prayers."
Senate floor proceedings will be postponed¬†until October 19th.¬†The @SenJudiciary confirmation hearings for Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court will convene¬†on October 12th¬†as scheduled by Chairman Graham. My full statement: https://t.co/7ThKZPJBZG

"Just finished a great phone call with @POTUS. He‚Äôs in good spirits and we talked business ‚Äî especially how impressed Senators are with the qualifications of Judge Barrett. Full steam ahead with the fair, thorough, timely process that the nominee, the Court, &amp; the country deserve."
Happy to hear the White House physician‚Äôs report that @POTUS and @FLOTUS are feeling well following their positive tests for COVID-19. Let‚Äôs continue to pray today and every day for our President and our First Lady and for all those impacted by COVID-19.
Tune in now to @BretBaier. I‚Äôll be discussing Judge Barrett‚Äôs nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats‚Äô ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief.
"Everyone who knows Judge Barrett, across the political spectrum, praises her independence and impartiality.

A judge's job is to follow the facts and the law wherever they lead. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's revealing how much this basic concept seems to scare the far left."
"Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court. Vice President Biden refused to rule it out last night. Now Senate Democrats are demanding promises and pre-commitments from Judge Barrett.
¬†
Judicial independence is vital to the rule of law. Why are Republicans alone in defending it?"
"Judge Barrett is an exemplary judge and a qualified nominee for the Supreme Court. Her legal peers across the political spectrum praise her independence, fair-mindedness, and impartiality. That is exactly what the American people deserve on their highest Court. https://t.co/Eawb6JuCeX"
"Multiple times, with multiple nominees, Senate Democrats have said or implied that certain personal religious beliefs make Americans unfit to serve. Judge Barrett in 2017 was only one example. Now the media‚Äôs joining in.

These tactics need to stop now. https://t.co/wisPUKXe2O"
I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Barrett earlier today. President Trump has nominated exactly the kind of outstanding person whom the American people deserve to have on their highest Court. https://t.co/0tTJqPwpeP
"Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.
¬†
A brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision. https://t.co/FKadx6TJeU"
"Tune in: I‚Äôm about to join @ShannonBream @foxnewsnight for my first interview on the Supreme Court vacancy. The Senate will do what we did in 2016: Follow history, follow precedent, and do the job we were elected to do."
"The far left called John Paul Stevens anti-woman. They said Anthony Kennedy would turn back the clock. David Souter was going to hurt ‚Äúwomen, minorities, dissenters, &amp; other groups"" from the bench.
 
Anyone doubt the same old smears will be rearing their heads starting Saturday?"
"We don‚Äôt know which legal all-star the President will nominate on Saturday. So isn't it curious that everyone already knows exactly what smears and scare tactics the far left will trot out?
 
Their playbook has not changed for 45 years. The nominee is irrelevant to their attacks."
"My full statement on Breonna Taylor, yesterday‚Äôs announcement, and the violence overnight in my hometown of Louisville: https://t.co/NN70M9oun8"
The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792.
House Democrats‚Äô first government funding bill intentionally left rural America behind. But @SenJoniErnst and other Republicans did not let the Democrats defund farm country. They secured the Commodity Credit Corporation funding that our farmers and ranchers depend on.
"Yesterday, Sen. Schumer decided to vent his frustration by blocking a bipartisan Intelligence Committee meeting on counterintelligence with a leading expert on protecting our elections.

A partisan temper tantrum is one thing. Jeopardizing national security is a different story."
"Rewarding Democrats‚Äô tactics now would not stop their attacks on our institutions. Their threats predate this new vacancy by over a year.
 
Their recklessness only underscores the importance that we do our job and confirm a nominee who truly respects the Constitution."
"Democrats are threatening to attack the foundations of the Senate and the Court if they do not get their way.
 
Here's the problem with this attempted blackmail: They have already been making these threats for many months. They've been campaigning on them for over a year."
"Our Senate majority will do exactly the same thing in 2020 that we did in 2016: Follow Senate history, follow the clear precedent in each situation, and do exactly the job we were elected to do.
¬†
We are going to vote on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court this year."
"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a generational legal giant and a trailblazing champion for American women. The Senate is grieving with the nation, praying for her family, and remembering her historic legacy.

My full Senate floor remarks: https://t.co/mfVTHURqIw"
House Democrats‚Äô rough draft of a government funding bill shamefully leaves out key relief and support that American farmers need. This is no time to add insult to injury and defund help for farmers and rural America.
"The Senate and the nation mourn the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life.

My full statement: https://t.co/NOwYLhDxIk"
"Today we honor National POW/MIA Recognition Day. More than 1300 patriotic Kentuckians still haven‚Äôt come home. They are not forgotten, and we are still searching."

That's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID. https://t.co/Byrmh3DgD8"
It‚Äôs been less than a year since my bill with Senator Kaine and @SenToddYoung raised the nationwide age for tobacco purchases to 21. We just learned there‚Äôs already been a major decline in e-cigarette use among young people. Huge bipartisan progress for the health of our kids. https://t.co/yosvf0SA56
"Even Speaker Pelosi‚Äôs own House Democrats are sick of her blocking COVID-19 relief.

But she insists anything short of her multi-trillion wish list would make Democrats ‚Äúa cheap date.‚Äù What a joke.

People are hurting. They need help. Not the Speaker's pointless political games."
"Today is an historic day for Middle East peace. Landmark agreements formalized at the White House between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. Thanks to the U.S. and the Trump administration, the winds of change are blowing across toward progress and peace."
"The framers designed the Senate to be the country‚Äôs firewall against bad ideas and radical change. If Democrats are afraid their bad ideas could never meet the bar, it‚Äôs their proposals that need to be scrapped, not our country‚Äôs checks and balances."
Great news: Experts have found a huge decline in teen vaping. This is just what we sought with my landmark legislation to increase the required age for all tobacco products to 21. Health officials say that law made a big difference. https://t.co/dqhz6fhQwg
The Trump administration has helped secured two historic peace agreements between Israel and Arab nations in just the last few days. The winds of change are blowing and the Middle East is changing for the better. My full statement: https://t.co/FDbUKWrCpN
"Senate Democrats are threatening to blow up the filibuster if they gain power and ram far-left policies through the Senate. But they just used the filibuster last week to block COVID relief. They used it this summer to kill @SenatorTimScott‚Äôs police reform bill.

Total hypocrisy."
"All military families serve alongside their loved ones in uniform. The new Gold Star Families Memorial in Owensboro, KY commemorates the sacrifices these patriots made in the name of freedom. The nation can never repay our debt. But we can keep these families in our prayers. https://t.co/5bZkjgwqlB"
"Washington Democrats have now blocked two separate proposals to provide hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, jobs, and healthcare. They just do not want American families getting more help before the election. Pure cynicism."
"Nineteen years ago, thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks burned. Brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.
 
May we never fail to honor them. And may we never tire of our pledge: Never Again. https://t.co/95QqWlm05m"
"ICYMI I joined @DanaPerino to discuss Speaker Pelosi &amp; Leader Schumer's continued efforts to block coronavirus relief funding for Americans.

Senate Republicans are working over the weekend to ensure that Democrat shenanigans don‚Äôt slow down Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs confirmation. It‚Äôs a shame to see how Democrats have politicized the judicial confirmation process over the last 30-plus years. https://t.co/2G6l4hNhhs
"Since Judge Barrett's qualifications are beyond reproach, many on the left have instead turned to distortions &amp; distractions. Americans won't be fooled &amp; have seen through these tactics. It‚Äôs no surprise that a majority of Americans support her confirmation. https://t.co/6MCNgwojf0"

"Hard to believe that Senate Democrats just voted AGAIN to block COVID relief. There are Americans who can't feed their families because of the economic side effects of COVID-19 shutdowns, yet Democrats still refuse to act unless GOP allows 2.4 trillion in irresponsible spending."
"‚ÄúI apply the law. I follow the law. You make policy.‚Äù - Judge Barrett

"Democrats have presented two options at the negotiating table: $2.4 trillion in government spending or zero-point-zero dollars in relief. 

If you refuse to look for a middle ground, you aren't negotiating. 

I hope Democrats think of their constituents and change course."
"Why haven't we passed more COVID relief? Let‚Äôs boil this down, because it‚Äôs pretty simple. Dems are sabotaging negotiations &amp; holding relief hostage over blue-state bailouts.

I think it‚Äôs abundantly clear to everyone ‚Äì my colleagues across the aisle included ‚Äì that Judge Barrett is absolutely qualified to be a Supreme Court justice. https://t.co/AOzjYULhNg
"To anyone watching today, it is absolutely clear how qualified Judge Barrett is to serve on the Supreme Court."
"Watching today's hearing, you would‚Äôve thought it was a floor debate on health care. Dems know they can‚Äôt fault Judge Barrett on her merits, so they‚Äôre relying on scare tactics. The truth is, we have no idea how¬†she¬†will rule on any case. But we do know she'll follow the law."
I was proud to watch my @SenateGOP colleagues defend religious liberty at today‚Äôs hearing. Our Constitution specifically bans religious tests for public service. No one‚Äôs religion ‚Äì whatever it is ‚Äì can disqualify them to serve on the court. Nor should it.
"Today, in South Dakota, we‚Äôre celebrating Native Americans' Day.¬†I am proud to serve all of our¬†Dakota, Nakota, and Lakota people, and I‚Äôm thankful to live in a state that celebrates its Native American history &amp; traditions."

"In America, we can't discriminate based on religion. 
We can't refuse to hire someone because of their religion.
Yet, some Democrat senators are already questioning whether Judge Barrett‚Äôs religion is a reason she isn't fit to serve on SCOTUS.
That's not right."
"Anyone who fairly &amp; honestly evaluates Judge Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs fitness to serve on the Supreme Court will find a supremely qualified nominee with decades of experience.

"The focus of this SCOTUS process should be on Judge Barrett &amp; her tremendous judicial record. She knows the next few weeks are going to be tough, but off the bat, I want to say how shameful it is that some have already begun to question her faith. We should be above such attacks."
