Marcel Rodarte Exec Director of @contractcities has just asked a series of great questions. Hope we can get those answered today.
A lot of public comment this morning from people who are concerned about the plan to close outdoor dining. I am listening and I hear you.

"I am worried about the workers and small businesses who will bear the brunt of shutdowns. 

If you share my concern, I am pleading with you not to gather with people outside your household. 

Workers and businesses need us to turn this around."
"While I know our case counts are growing rapidly, I would have rather discussed this measure openly during our Board of Supervisors meeting so that the public could understand the rationale behind it. https://t.co/0mo949cstF"
"We had another day of high COVID cases: 4,272. 

If we hit 5 days of 4000 cases, we'll move to only allow restaurants to operate for takeout and delivery. 4500 cases over 5 days will trigger a 3-week Safer At Home order.

I sat down with @KCRW to explain: https://t.co/Lck6bH1gm6"

"We just reported 5,000 new cases today-- a single-day high for the @CountyofLA. 

Hospitalizations are rising and could overwhelm our system in a matter of weeks. 

The situation is dire. 

Abide by Governor Newsom's curfew. Please stay home and only leave for essentials."
"LA County‚Äôs Auditor-Controller will do a random drawing to select the people who will serve on the County‚Äôs Citizens Redistricting Commission. 

For transparency‚Äôs sake‚Äî this drawing should be live-streamed for the public to witness in real-time."
"3,944 new cases today in LA County and hospitalizations up yet again. 

This puts us dangerously close to the 4,000 five-day average that would trigger shutting down outdoor dining.  

A 3 week Safer-At-Home Order would be triggered at five-day avg of 4,500 cases. https://t.co/aDuo9CJeD4"
